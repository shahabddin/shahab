                    <h3>Development of a portable scanning system for the detection of sub-surface rivet-related defects in aircraft
                        structures using Lock-in Thermography</h3>
                    <p><em>Duration: June 2023 till date</em></p>
                    <p>This project relates to the development of a novel Lock-In Thermography-based scanning system to detect 
                        subsurface defects in aircraft rivets. The system includes a customized thermographic device 
                        consisting of a thermal camera, heating source, synchronized control circuitry, and an indiginously developed
                        image processing based software utilizing the Discrete Wavelet Transform, augmented by spatial gradient 
                        and mean filtering methods. The software is integrated into a portable robotic arm (developed in-house),
                        which is wirelessly controlled using a custom-made GUI from a tablet. This robotic arm can scan the inside of
                        engine intake as well as other areas of aircraft for defective rivet detection.</p>

                    <h3>Human activity recognition in aerial videos</h3>
                    <p><em>Duration: November 2022 to May 2023</em></p>
                    <p spellcheck="true">Human activity recognition is a crucial component of security and serveillance systems. To this end, a
                        computationally efficient method is proposed for human activity recognition in aerial videos. The method
                        is based on the extraction of skeletal keypoints from video frames, which are then fed to a Transformer
                        network for action classifcation. Different pose extractors were used for skeletal data retrieval such as 
                        OpenPose, EfficientPost, DensePose, YOLOv7, YOLOv8 etc. with YOLOv8 being the most efficient in terms of accuracy
                        and computational cost. The method is tested on a publicly available dataset and compared with several state of the art techniques
                        such as ST-GCN, PA3D, PoTion etc. with our method performing better in terms of accuracy and computational cost. This project resulted 
                        in a paper publication in IEEE Access.</p>

                    <h3>Development of Medical Otoscope for the diagonosis of internal ear canal</h3>
                    <p><em>Duration: February 2023 to May 2023</em></p>
                    <p spellcheck="true">An Otoscope is a medical device which is used to look into the ear canal for diagonostic purposes. Health practitioners
                        use Otoscope to diagnose ear infections during regular checkups and also to investigate ear symptoms. An Otoscope potentially gives a view of the 
                        internal ear canal and tympanic membrane or eardrum. Video Otoscope is the use of a short and rigid endoscope that uses a video camera 
                        to transmit images to a larger screen for magnification. This Otoscope is designed by using an endoscope camera connected to a Raspberry
                        Pi 4B board, and a customised GUI to control its functionality. It is powered by a rechargable battery, which lasts for about 2 hours 
                        once fully charged.</p>
