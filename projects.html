                    <h3>Development of an Islam specific chatbot based on LLMs</h3>
                    <p><em>Duration: March 2025 till date</em></p>
                    <p>This is a side project that I started because of a dire need of easy access to authentic
                        Islamic information. The chatbot uses Paraphrase Multilingual MiniLM L12 V2 for sentence embedding and mT5 
                        model (Multilingual varient of the T5 Model) as the base model for query and response generation. It is bieng 
                        trained on a dataset of Islamic books, Hadiths and Quranic verses from scanned pdfs. The chatbot is being 
                        trained on Urdu, Arabic, Farsi and English texts, as most of the Islamic corpus is in these languages, but it 
                        can communicate in many languages as is the capability of the mT5 model. The chatbot will also be integrated 
                        with voice recognition system for a more simple and easy use.</p>

                    <h3>Development of a portable scanning system for the detection of sub-surface rivet-related defects in aircraft
                        structures using Lock-in Thermography</h3>
                    <p><em>Duration: June 2023 till date</em></p>
                    <p>This project relates to the development of a novel Lock-In Thermography-based scanning system to detect 
                        subsurface defects in aircraft rivets. The system includes a customized thermographic device 
                        consisting of a thermal camera (IRS320S), heating source (Halogen Bulbs), synchronized control circuitry, 
                        and an indiginously developed
                        image processing based software utilizing the Discrete Wavelet Transform, augmented by spatial gradient 
                        and mean filtering methods. The software is integrated into a portable robotic arm (developed in-house),
                        which is wirelessly controlled using a custom-made GUI from a tablet. This robotic arm can scan the inside of
                        engine intake as well as other areas of aircraft for defective rivet detection.</p>
                    <p>
                        This is a 16 million PKR (57000 USD) project managed and completed by 2 research assistants including me, and
                        supervised first by Dr. Haris Ali Khan and then by Dr. Zahid Ahmed Qureshi of NUST. This device will prevent almost 
                        500 million USD loss annually which is currently being faced by the Pakistan aviation industry due to faulty rivets.

                    <p>The most crucial part of the portable scanning system for defect detection in aircraft structures is the 
                        Lock-in Thermography system, in which the intensity of the halogen lamps is modulated according to the 
                        selected frequency. This system is indiginously developed using Raspberry Pi as the main control unit, along 
                        with a digital voltage regulator (RobotDyn), ESP32 and a Thermal camera. The ESP32 module modulates the AC voltage 
                        through the digital voltage regulator, upon recieving a signal from the GUI created in Raspberry Pi. At the 
                        same time, the Thermal Camera starts capturing the thermal profile of the target area.</p>

                    <p spellcheck="true">Human activity recognition is a crucial component of security and serveillance systems. To this end, a
                        computationally efficient method is proposed for human activity recognition in aerial videos. The method
                        is based on the extraction of skeletal keypoints from video frames, which are then fed to a Transformer
                        network for action classifcation. Different pose extractors were used for skeletal data retrieval such as 
                        OpenPose, EfficientPost, DensePose, YOLOv7, YOLOv8 etc. with YOLOv8 being the most efficient in terms of accuracy
                        and computational cost. The method is tested on a publicly available dataset and compared with several state of the art techniques
                        such as ST-GCN, PA3D, PoTion etc. with our method performing better in terms of accuracy and computational cost. This project resulted 
                        in a paper publication in IEEE Access.</p>

                    <p><em>Duration: February 2023 to May 2023</em></p>
                    <p spellcheck="true">An Otoscope is a medical device which is used to look into the ear canal for diagonostic purposes. Health practitioners
                        use Otoscope to diagnose ear infections during regular checkups and also to investigate ear symptoms. An Otoscope potentially gives a view of the 
                        internal ear canal and tympanic membrane or eardrum. Video Otoscope is the use of a short and rigid endoscope that uses a video camera 
                        to transmit images to a larger screen for magnification. This Otoscope is designed by using an endoscope camera connected to a Raspberry
                        Pi 4B board, and a customised GUI to control its functionality. It is powered by a rechargable battery, which lasts for about 2 hours 
                        once fully charged.</p>
