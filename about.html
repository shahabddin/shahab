                <article class="news-updates">
                    <p>I am a dedicated researcher with almost 3 years of experience in Image Processing, Computer Vision, Deep 
                        Learning and IoT. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of 
                        Engineering and Technology Peshawar, Pakistan. My passion for research and innovation has led me to work on 
                        cutting-edge projects that integrate AI and automation for real-world applications. Currently, I am serving 
                        as a Research Assistant at the College of Aeronautical Engineering (CAE), National University of Sciences & 
                        Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan, where I am leading the development of a portable scanning system for 
                        the detection of rivet-related defects in aircraft structures using lock-in thermography.</p> 
                    <p>Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at the National Center of Robotics & Automation (NCRA), 
                            National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan, contributing to the design and 
                            implementation of computer vision and IoT-based solutions. My notable  works include a Skeletal 
                            Keypoint-Based Transformer Model for Human Action Recognition in Aerial Videos, which utilizes deep 
                            learning techniques for activity recognition. Also, I have led and contributed to multiple projects, 
                            such as an intrusion detection system using YOLO and DeepSORT, early forest fire detection and a medical 
                            otoscope for ear canal diagnosis. My expertise in Image Processing and AI is reflected in my research 
                            publications in renowned journals such as IEEE Access and another in Mechanical Systems and Signal 
                            Processing. My technical  proficiency spans Programming (Python, MATLAB, Linux), IoT (Arduino, ESP32) and 
                            Embedded Systems (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano). My commitment to continuous learning is evident through 
                            multiple certifications in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative Adversarial 
                            Networks (GANs) equipping me with advanced skills in CNN architectures, NLP models, and AI-driven image 
                            processing. With a research-driven mindset and strong technical acumen, I am deeply committed to 
                            advancing AI, automation, and intelligent systems, aiming to develop innovative solutions that push the 
                            boundaries of technology and its real-world applications.</p>
                    <p><b>I am actively looking for research collaboration as well as scholarship opportunities for higher studies.</b></p><br>
