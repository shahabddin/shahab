                    <p>
                        I am a dedicated researcher with expertise in Computer Vision, IoT, and Machine Learning, specializing in 
                        deep learning, image processing, and embedded systems. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical 
                        Engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology Peshawar, Pakistan where I developed a strong 
                        foundation in communication systems. My passion for research and innovation has led me to work on cutting-edge 
                        projects that integrate AI and automation for real-world applications. Currently, I am serving as a Research 
                        Assistant at the College of Aeronautical Engineering (CAE), National University of Sciences & Technology 
                        (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan, where I am leading the development of a portable scanning system for the detection of rivet-related 
                        defects in aircraft structures using lock-in thermography.</p> 
                        <p>Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant 
                        at the National Center of Robotics & Automation (NCRA), National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), 
                        Islamabad, contributing to the design and implementation of computer vision and IoT-based solutions. My notable 
                        works include a Skeletal Keypoint-Based 
                        Transformer Model for Human Action Recognition in Aerial Videos, which utilizes deep learning techniques for 
                        activity recognition. Beyond research, I have led and contributed to multiple projects, such as an intrusion 
                        detection system using YOLO and DeepSORT, a medical otoscope for ear canal diagnosis, and the development of a 
                        portable scanning system for defective rivets detection based on Lock-in Thermography using Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, Arduino, and ESP32 etc. My 
                        expertise in AI and deep learning is reflected in my research publications in renowned journals such as IEEE 
                        Access and Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing. My technical 
                        proficiency spans Programming, IoT and Embedded Systems, with extensive experience in AI model optimization, 
                        data wrangling and cleaning. My commitment to continuous learning is evident through multiple certifications in Deep 
                        Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) equipping me with 
                        advanced skills in CNN architectures, NLP models, and AI-driven image 
                        processing. My contributions have earned me recognition, including the Prime Minister Laptop Scheme Award for 
                        academic excellence, and I am a registered engineer with the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC). In addition 
                        to my research and technical endeavors, I actively engage in professional development through hands-on 
                        workshops and training in areas like PCB design, 3D printing, collaborative robotics, and aerial drone 
                        technology. With a research-driven mindset and strong technical acumen, I am deeply committed to advancing AI, 
                        automation, and intelligent systems, aiming to develop innovative solutions that push the boundaries of 
                        technology and its real-world applications.
