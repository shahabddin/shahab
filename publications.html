                    A Lock-In Thermography based post-processing scheme for the detection of sub-surface rivet-related

                    <p>This research is focused on developing a novel Lock-In Thermography-based scanning system to detect 
                        subsurface defects in aircraft rivets. The proposed system included a customized thermographic device 
                        consisting of a thermal camera, heating source, synchronized control circuitry, and post-processing 
                        software utilizing the Discrete Wavelet Transform technique, augmented by spatial gradient and mean 
                        filtering methods. To validate the developed system, a two-pronged hierarchical approach was adopted. 
                        The detection scheme for looseness and internal cracks in rivets was first developed and refined in a 
                        lab environment. After successful trials on lab samples, the scheme was further employed in different 
                        areas of actual aircraft. A total of 751 rivets were scanned for looseness and internal cracks, and a 
                        very promising detection rate was observed, confirmed through visual inspection and microscopic analysis. 
                        The developed setup can be further extended to other sub-surface defects such as corrosion and other 
                        structural non-homogeneities.</p>

                    Skeletal Keypoint-Based Transformer Model for Human Action Recognition in Aerial Videos</a></h3>
                    <p><em>Date: 15th January 2024</em></p>

                    <p>Several efforts have been made to develop effective and robust vision-based solutions for human action 
                        recognition in aerial videos. Generally, the existing methods rely on the extraction of either spatial 
                        features (patch-based methods) or skeletal key points (pose-based methods) that are fed to a classifier. 
                        Unlike the patch-based methods, the pose-based methods are generally regarded to be more robust to background 
                        changes and computationally efficient. Moreover, at the classification stage, the use of deep networks has 
                        generated significant interest within the community; however, the need remains to develop accurate and 
                        computationally effective deep learning-based solutions. To this end, this paper proposes a lightweight 
                        Transformer network-based method for human action recognition in aerial videos using the skeletal keypoints 
                        extracted using YOLOv8. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown on a well-known public dataset 
                        containing 13 action classes, achieving very encouraging performance in terms of accuracy and computational 
                        cost as compared to several existing related methods.</p>

                    A Novel mmWave Defected Ground Structure Based Microstrip Antenna for 5G Cellular Applications</a></h3>

                    <p>A dual-band high-performance circular patch microstrip antenna for future 5th generation (5G) of mobile 
                        communication is proposed. The designed antenna has a ring-shaped Defected Ground Structure (DGS) in the 
                        ground plane. The proposed antenna operates at 28GHz (27.68GHz - 28.55GHz, 3.10%), which is a proposed 
                        frequency for 5G. A ring-shaped Defected Ground Structure is suitably inserted in the ground plane resulting 
                        in an additional frequency band at 38GHz (37.13GHz - 38.20GHz, 2.81%). The gain of the antenna at 28GHz is 
                        6.87dBi and 4.17dBi at 38GHz. The size of the proposed antenna is 7.23mm x 7.23mm. The introduction of 
                        Defected Ground Structure also improved the antenna performance. Furthermore, different parameters of the 
                        proposed antenna are varied, studied and discussed in detail to observe its effects on the antenna performance.</p>
